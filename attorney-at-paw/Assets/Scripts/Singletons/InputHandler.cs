    /// 
    /// How to add a funtions that respond to user input (esp. keypresses)
    ///     - Most Ideal: make function in MenuInputManager and place it in its appropriate spot
    ///         - e.g. 'eve-interact-key' should only work, say, outside of dialogue and menus,
    ///         so its appropriate behvaiour is performed by a funtion in ProtoInputHandler and placed
    ///         properly into the private 'DistributeInput()' method at the bottom where actions
    ///         that only occur outside of menus and dialogue occur.
    ///     - Also Valid: locally handle the update and keypress
    ///         - Obviously, it can be clunky, time-consuming, and/or foolish to handle certain calls in this file
    ///         - Conditions for locally updating and handling the keypresses
    ///             - Please use abstractable keys. Not already here? Add it!
    ///             - Make sure to account for call context (since, otherwise ProtoInputHandler would account for it)
    ///                 - e.g. the beheviour must not occur whenever it shouldn't occur
    ///                 which means that the behaviour must have a way of ascertaining its context
